I am a scientist with a talent for writing and editing. My educational background is in physics and the geosciences, where I have written and published numerous academic papers. Through this experience I have met many international students and scientists who are extremely intelligent, but have difficulties in communicating their ideas effectively in English. To help such individuals, I offer my service in editing academic papers, university applications, and other work. My rates are lower than the average editor. Please email me ( huffediting@gmail.com ), or reach out to me on WeChat ( wxid_6lh78l2xsxsu22 ) with your writing problem and I will be happy to assist.
